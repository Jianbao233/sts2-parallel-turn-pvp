# CHANGELOG

## 2026-04-10 Stable Checkpoint
- removed live combat checksum drift caused by direct `RoundResult` snapshot application

- added first-pass limited-intent overlay in combat UI
- prepared repository documentation for rollback, handoff, and review

## 2026-04-09 Major Progress
- built independent `ParallelTurnPvp` Godot/.NET project and release pipeline
- added `torelease` bundle for direct copy to secondary machine
- integrated optional `DirectConnectIP` compatibility for no-Steam/IP testing
